This week's task was to create a Password Generator, to complete the criteria i followed this steps.

everytime the "generate password" button is clicked you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
The desired length for the password will be the first prompt.

An "if" statement had to be created for the prompt to work if a cetain criteria was met then you would be presented with the other prompts otherwise an alert window would be display to makee you atart over until you meet the first prompt window criteria.

After you specify the lenght of the password and decide on whether or not it should include special characters, numbers, uppercase and lower case letters then a random password would be created using the "Math.random" method.

The password is then displayed in written to the page.
